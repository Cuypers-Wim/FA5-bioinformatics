# About {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the Bioinformatics Module of the Fighting Malaria Across Borders (FiMAB) international training programme, created by the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Antwerp (Belgium) and supported by VLIR-UOS. Its primary goal is to support the implementation of targeted sequencing assays (in particular, AmpliSeq) to strengthen malaria molecular surveillance and help guide national control programmes. In conjunction with laboratory training, this bioinformatics course is intended to allow young academics around the globe to become familiar with molecular surveillance as a key activity to monitor transmission, sources of epidemics and the emergence and spread of drug resistance mutations in the _Plasmodium_ parasite.

## Scope of the course

This course aims to provide an overview of key bioinformatics aspects related to performing molecular surveillance research in _Plasmodium_. It is divided into the following sections:

1. Introduction to the Unix shell (command line interface)
2. Introduction to R
3. Population genetics and molecular epidemiology for _Plasmodium_ [to follow later]

Section 1-2 are online self-paced modules, whereas section 3 will include classroom lectures and practical sessions. Evaluation exercises will be conducted on [the ITM course page](https://campus.itg.be/course/view.php?id=217).
