The bash scripts in this directory (`download_*.sh`) can be used to download (subsets of) the raw fastq data to be used during the practical exercises

The downloads will be stored in subdirectories of `./training/data/fastq` named after the BioProject from which the samples are derived.

These scripts were based on the excellent tool: [https://sra-explorer.info/#](https://sra-explorer.info/#), but you could equivalently use NCBI's own [SRA Run Selector](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/study/).
