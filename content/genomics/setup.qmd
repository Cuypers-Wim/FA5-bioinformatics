# Setup and preparations {.unnumbered}

For this hands-on practical on processing genomics data for variant calling, we will make use of the same GitHub Codespaces that were introduced in @sec-unix-setup.

Due to the large file size of the training data, not all files were included directly in the repository. When you launch your codespace for the first time (or whenever you create a new one), you will need to run the download scripts that are stored in `./training/data/`, as described in the [README.md](../../training/data/README.md).

If you want to follow along on your own machine instead, make sure to install all the required software tools. The easiest option is to use `conda`/`mamba` via the [miniforge installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), and then installing all the packages described in the [environment.yml file](../../environment.yml). For R, simply install the list of packages described in the [devcontainer.json file](../../.devcontainer/rstudio/devcontainer.json) (or `renv` file if it is available).

**On Linux:**

```bash
# download and install miniforge
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh

# install relevant packages into a new environment
mamba env create -n fimab -f /tmp/conda-tmp/environment.yml

# activate environment
mamba activate fimab
```

**On Windows:**

- Download and run the [latest Windows installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe)
- On your command line, run:

    ```cmd
    # install relevant packages into a new environment
    mamba env create -n fimab -f /tmp/conda-tmp/environment.yml

    # activate environment
    mamba activate fimab
    ```
