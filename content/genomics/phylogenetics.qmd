## Storyline: Malaria in Ethiopia [excercise not performed during course, will be updated]

Now, it's time to apply your phylogenetics skills to determine where the patient in our storyline contracted their malaria infection.

You will be working with a dataset called 'contextual data.' Although the data is simulated for this exercise, in real scenarios, we often rely on public datasets with robust metadata to make such inferences.

Start your analysis and explore what insights you can draw from the phylogeny. Donâ€™t forget to create a visualization of the phylogenetic tree!
