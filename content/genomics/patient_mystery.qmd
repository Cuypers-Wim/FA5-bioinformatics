# Patient mystery {#sec-patient-mystery}

Now it is time for an excercise where you will employ all the techniques from the previous sessions. You can read the storyline for this excercise below.

## Malaria in Ethiopia
A patient arrives at your research clinic with a high fever. Despite initially suspecting malaria, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is negative. However, a microscopic examination of the blood sample reveals *Plasmodium* parasites, confirming malaria. Microscopy allows you to determine that the parasite is *Plasmodium* *falciparum*, a species known to cause severe malaria. This situation raises several questions: How was the infection acquired? Is it a local strain or one from recent travel? Why did the rapid test fail?

The patient, originally from Ethiopia—where both *P. falciparum* and *P. vivax* are prevalent—has recently traveled to Southeast Asia, where both species also circulate. The failure of the rapid test could be linked to deletions in the *hrp2* and *hrp3* genes, which are common in *P. falciparum* and cause some RDTs to miss infections. 

Your task is to analyze the parasite’s genetic material to confirm which strain it is, determine its likely geographic origin, and assess potential antimicrobial treatments. This analysis will also help clarify why the rapid test failed and whether the strain carries any mutations affecting test performance or drug resistance.
