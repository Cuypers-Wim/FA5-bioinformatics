            Library preparation protocols for most sequencing technologies involve {PCR} amplification of the template {DNA}, which open the possibility that a given template {DNA} molecule is sequenced multiple times. Reads arising from this phenomenon, known as {PCR} duplicates, inflate the cost of sequencing and can jeopardize the reliability of affected experiments. Despite the pervasiveness of this artefact, our understanding of its causes and of its impact on downstream statistical analyses remains essentially empirical. Here, we develop a general quantitative model of amplification distortions in sequencing data sets, which we leverage to investigate the factors controlling the occurrence of {PCR} duplicates. We show that the {PCR} duplicate rate is determined primarily by the ratio between library complexity and sequencing depth, and that amplification noise (including in its dependence on the number of {PCR} cycles) only plays a secondary role for this artefact. We confirm our predictions using new and published {RAD}‐seq libraries and provide a method to estimate library complexity and amplification noise in any data set containing {PCR} duplicates. We discuss how amplification‐related artefacts impact downstream analyses, and in particular genotyping accuracy. The proposed framework unites the numerous observations made on {PCR} duplicates and will be useful to experimenters of all sequencing technologies where {DNA} availability is a concern.},

              . Several genetic surveillance applications (‘use cases’) have been identified to align research, technology development, and public health efforts, requiring different types of molecular markers. Here we present a new highly-multiplexed deep sequencing assay (Pv {AmpliSeq}). The assay targets the 33-{SNP} {vivaxGEN}-geo panel for country-level classification, and a newly designed 42-{SNP} within-country barcode for analysis of parasite dynamics in Vietnam and 11 putative drug resistance genes in a highly multiplexed {NGS} protocol with easy workflow, applicable for many different genetic surveillance use cases. The Pv {AmpliSeq} assay was validated using: 1) isolates from travelers and migrants in Belgium, and 2) routine collections of the national malaria control program at sentinel sites in Vietnam. The assay targets 229 amplicons and achieved a high depth of coverage (mean 595.7 ± 481) and high accuracy (mean error-rate of 0.013 ± 0.007).
              P. vivax
              parasites could be characterized from dried blood spots with a minimum of 5 parasites/µL and 10\% of minority-clones. The assay achieved good spatial specificity for between-country prediction of origin using the 33-{SNP} {vivaxGEN}-geo panel that targets rare alleles specific for certain countries and regions. A high resolution for within-country diversity in Vietnam was achieved using the designed 42-{SNP} within-country barcode that targets common alleles (median {MAF} 0.34, range 0.01-0.49. Many variants were detected in (putative) drug resistance genes, with different predominant haplotypes in the

The capacity of the assay for high resolution identity-by-descent ({IBD}) analysis was demonstrated and identified a high rate of shared ancestry within Gia Lai Province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, as well as between the coastal province of Binh Thuan and Lam Dong. Our approach performed well in geographically differentiating isolates at multiple spatial scales, detecting variants in putative resistance genes, and can be easily adjusted to suit the needs in other settings in a country or region. We prioritize making this tool available to researchers and {NMCPs} in endemic countries to increase ownership and ensure data usage for decision-making and malaria policy.},

            {ABSTRACT}

              Molecular surveillance for malaria has great potential to support national malaria control programs ({NMCPs}). To bridge the gap between research and implementation, several applications (use cases) have been identified to align research, technology development, and public health efforts. For implementation at {NMCPs}, there is an urgent need for feasible and cost-effective tools. We designed a new highly multiplexed deep sequencing assay (Pf {AmpliSeq}), which is compatible with benchtop sequencers, that allows high-accuracy sequencing with higher coverage and lower cost than whole-genome sequencing ({WGS}), targeting genomic regions of interest. The novelty of the assay is its high number of targets multiplexed into one easy workflow, combining population genetic markers with 13 nearly full-length resistance genes, which is applicable for many different use cases. We provide the first proof of principle for
              hrp2
              and
              hrp3
              deletion detection using amplicon sequencing. Initial sequence data processing can be performed automatically, and subsequent variant analysis requires minimal bioinformatic skills using any tabulated data analysis program. The assay was validated using a retrospective sample collection (
              n
               = 254) from the Peruvian Amazon between 2003 and 2018. By combining phenotypic markers and a within-country 28-single-nucleotide-polymorphism ({SNP}) barcode, we were able to distinguish different lineages with multiple resistance haplotypes (in
              dhfr, dhps, crt
              and
              mdr1
              ) and
              hrp2
              and
              hrp3
              deletions, which have been increasing in recent years. We found no evidence to suggest the emergence of artemisinin ({ART}) resistance in Peru. These findings indicate a parasite population that is under drug pressure but is susceptible to current antimalarials and demonstrate the added value of a highly multiplexed molecular tool to inform malaria strategies and surveillance systems.


              {IMPORTANCE}
              While the power of next-generation sequencing technologies to inform and guide malaria control programs has become broadly recognized, the integration of genomic data for operational incorporation into malaria surveillance remains a challenge in most countries where malaria is endemic. The main obstacles include limited infrastructure, limited access to high-throughput sequencing facilities, and the need for local capacity to run an in-country analysis of genomes at a large-enough scale to be informative for surveillance. In addition, there is a lack of standardized laboratory protocols and automated analysis pipelines to generate reproducible and timely results useful for relevant stakeholders. With our standardized laboratory and bioinformatic workflow, malaria genetic surveillance data can be readily generated by surveillance researchers and malaria control programs in countries of endemicity, increasing ownership and ensuring timely results for informed decision- and policy-making.},
