# Other R resources

Here is a collection of other useful resources for learning R.

- [Introduction to Data Science by Rafael A Irizarry](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/): a clear overview of the most important aspects of data analysis in R, covering basic syntax, data manipulation using the tidyverse, visualizations and a few productivity tools.
- [The Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/index.html): an extensive R reference manual for various epidemiological analyses.
    - [Applied Epi Tutorials](https://www.appliedepi.org/tutorial/): they also offer free self-paced R tutorials accessible online (requires registration). If you prefer learning in an interactive manner, then these are highly recommended. Also see [swirl - interactive tutorials in R](https://swirlstats.com/students.html).
- [Software Carpentry's R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/): this workshop goes over some of the other aspects of R that were not touched upon in the genomics workshop, e.g., data structures, loops, functions, etc.
- [Jenny Bryan's Stat 545](https://stat545.com/): an accessible guide to data wrangling, exploration and analysis in R. It also covers a few important aspects for newcomers related to [managing projects and treating your code as absolute rather than R's history](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/), as well as several other adjacent topics
- [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/): this book is a bit more advanced, but it is an excellent resource nonetheless. Hadley Wickham is one of the driving behind tidyverse and the author of the amazing [*Tidy Data* paper](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).
- [The Pirate's Guide to R](https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/): slightly whimsical and quite thorough.
- [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/): tons of examples for almost any kind of graphical representation you can imagine.
- [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/): a complete guide to the grammar of ggplot2.
- [PeterMac Data Science: Intro to R Tidyverse Course](https://pmacdasci.github.io/r-intro-tidyverse/): another introduction to the tidyverse, this time using the analysis of RNA-seq data as an example.
