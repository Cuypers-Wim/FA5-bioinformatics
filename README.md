# FA5 Bioinformatics training in Pathogen Genomics

This repository contains the materials for the FA5 Bioinformatics course, a collaborative effort supported by the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM) in Antwerp, the Armauer Hansen Research Institute (AHRI) in Addis Ababa, and the University of Antwerp, as part of the FA5 program.

Course notes are available at the following URL: [FA5 Bioinformatics](https://cuypers-wim.github.io/FA5-bioinformatics/).

The course builds on the "Fighting Malaria Across Borders" (FiMAB) programme, developed by ITM and supported by VLIR-UOS. You can find more information about the FiMAB bioinformatics course here: [FiMAB Bioinformatics](https://pmoris.github.io/FiMAB-bioinformatics/). This repo is also a fork of the FiMAB repo.
